        <h2>MPPC: Model Predictive Pandemic Control</h2>
        <p>My work in the project focused on the design and analysis of a deterministic compartmental model for pandemic outbreaks,
             whose parameters have been estimated by a Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) framework. The model guarantees parameters identifiability (a feature rarely considered in literature), and it is used to implement a scenario-based model predictive control (SBNMPC). The latter aims to optimally control an evolving pandemic via non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPIs).</p>
